The GUI
=======

This scripting platform is meant to be started by running ``scripting_gui.py``. This brings up a GUI in which you can select which script to run (``Script``), what data to run it on (``Input Data``), and where to put the post-processed data (``Output Data``). The checkboxes on the right select which columns will be included in the ``Output Data`` file.


Indices and tables
